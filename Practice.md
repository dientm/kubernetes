# Minikube

- Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

# Creating a service for an application running in five pods

0. Install Minikube to run K8s locally

1
```
kubectl run hello-world --replicas=5 --labels="run=load-balancer-example" --image=gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0  --port=8080

```

The preceding command creates a Deployment object and an associated ReplicaSet object. The ReplicaSet has five Pods, each of which runs the Hello World application.


2.   Display information about the Deployment:

```
kubectl get deployments hello-world

kubectl describe deployments hello-world
```

3. Display information about your ReplicaSet objects:

```
kubectl get replicasets
kubectl describe replicasets
```

4. Create a Service object that exposes the deployment:

```
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=LoadBalancer --name=my-service
```

5. Display information about the Service:

```
kubectl get services my-service
```

The output is similar to this:

```
NAME         CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)    AGE
my-service   10.3.245.137   104.198.205.71   8080/TCP   54s
```

6. Display detailed information about the Service:

```
kubectl describe services my-service
```

The output is similar to this:

```
Name:           my-service
Namespace:      default
Labels:         run=load-balancer-example
Annotations:    <none>
Selector:       run=load-balancer-example
Type:           LoadBalancer
IP:             10.3.245.137
LoadBalancer Ingress:   104.198.205.71
Port:           <unset> 8080/TCP
NodePort:       <unset> 32377/TCP
Endpoints:      10.0.0.6:8080,10.0.1.6:8080,10.0.1.7:8080 + 2 more...
Session Affinity:   None
Events:         <none>
```

Make a note of the external IP address (LoadBalancer Ingress) exposed by your service. In this example, the external IP address is 104.198.205.71. Also note the value of Port and NodePort. In this example, the Port is 8080 and the NodePort is 32377.

7. In the preceding output, you can see that the service has several endpoints: 10.0.0.6:8080,10.0.1.6:8080,10.0.1.7:8080 + 2 more. These are internal addresses of the pods that are running the Hello World application. To verify these are pod addresses, enter this command:

```
kubectl get pods â€“output=wide
```
The output is similar to this:

```
NAME                         ...  IP         NODE
hello-world-2895499144-1jaz9 ...  10.0.1.6   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-1afc
hello-world-2895499144-2e5uh ...  10.0.1.8   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-1afc
hello-world-2895499144-9m4h1 ...  10.0.0.6   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-5v7a
hello-world-2895499144-o4z13 ...  10.0.1.7   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-1afc
hello-world-2895499144-segjf ...  10.0.2.5   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-cpuc
```

8, Use the external IP address (LoadBalancer Ingress) to access the Hello World application:

```
curl http://<external-ip>:<port>
```
where <external-ip> is the external IP address (LoadBalancer Ingress) of your Service, and <port> is the value of Port in your Service description. If you are using minikube, typing minikube service my-service will automatically open the Hello World application in a browser.

The response to a successful request is a hello message:

```
Hello Kubernetes!
```

## Cleaning up

To delete the Service, enter this command:

```
kubectl delete services my-service
```

To delete the Deployment, the ReplicaSet, and the Pods that are running the Hello World application, enter this command:

```
kubectl delete deployment hello-world
```
